# Alt+Shift+N. It is a third colour and not a shade of either of the two above,
# because it says a third thing: "this window was moved, and you have not looked
# at it since". The accent above means "the keyboard is here" and the inactive
# colour means "nothing in particular", so a window marked with this one is
# neither of those and must not be mistakable for either.

# It stays on until the window is focused again, which is the act of having
# found it — so a hand that has sent three windows to three desks can still tell
# which three they were.
